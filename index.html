                <p>A pencil is a tool used for writing or draws anything. And writing of the pencil gets blurred over time.</p>
                <p>A pencil is made up of clay, graphite and wood.</p>
                <p>Children are taught to write with pencils first in their childhood because text written with a pencil can be erased with eraser and mistakes can be corrected easily using a pencil instead of pens.
                </p>
                <p> Normally a pencil costs Rs1 to Rs10.</p>

            <p>It gives a moral lesson to all fun-loving students who spend their valuable time in enjoying parties, movies, etc and not serious in studies because every moment of student life is valuable and time must be utilized by the students in regular studies . Now-a-days, students think that student life is very easy and full of fun today especially college life of the students. But the future of students depend upon their achievements in student life because the fun-loving students of today used smart ways to get good marks in examination which is shown in my story.</p>
            <p>Ashish and Amit were studying in the college. Both were classmates as well as roommates in the hostel room. Ashish was a studious boy but Amit was a fun-loving boy and was not serious in studies. Ashish used to study regularly to get good marks in exams whereas Amit was not serious in studies and used to study “Guess Paper”, “One-day Series “,etc. to get good marks in exams..</p>
